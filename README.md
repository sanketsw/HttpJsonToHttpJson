# JsonJsonApplication


Instead of REST API, This one is IIB Application. Created using IBM Integration Bus 10.0.0.3

The functionality is same as https://github.com/sanketsw/HttpRequestRestAPI.git (more details in its readme file)

the comparable REST API implementation in IIB is **JsonJsonRESTAPI**:  https://github.com/sanketsw/JsonJsonRestAPI. 

The REST API needs swagger specification. Application does not.
